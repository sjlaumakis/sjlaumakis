The Western approach has tended to rely on thescientific method, using empirical investigations and objective inquiryto specify the nature of consciousness. A recent approach to understandingthe nature of consciousness and thought (which has emerged and gained prominenceover the past 50 years) is termed <I>cognitive science</I>. Cognitive sciencerepresents an interdisciplinary attempt to understand the nature of thinking,and is rooted primarily in the following disciplines: philosophy, psychology,neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, and anthropology. Perhapsthe most lively interaction among these disciplines lies at the crossroadsof the first three--philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology (more specifically,cognitive psychology). In fact, much current work in cognitive science isfocused on trying to respond to basic philosophical questions about psychologicalprocesses (e.g., What is the nature of consciousness?) with the tools ofbrain science (e.g., brain imaging techniques such as PETscanning).</H3><H3>Eastern approaches (Buddhism, in particular) are also devoted to investigatingand understanding consciousness. However, their focus is on the analysisof subjective experience through meditative practice, and the cultivationof mindfulness-being awake and fully aware. Buddhists are especially concernedwith the practical and moral consequences of this meditative practice. Thissubjective and contemplative approach to analyzing consciousness can beseen in Western approaches in the form of analytic introspection (a populartool for analyzing consciousness early in the development of psychology),but was largely abandoned as unscientific. Recently, however, the phenomenologicalaspects of cognition and consciousness have made a comeback, and there hasbeen an important meeting of Eastern and Western minds with regard to theanalysis of consciousness. Both traditions are investigating the benefitsof meditation for psychological and physical well being, as well as whatthe meditative state tells us about the nature of consciousness and thought.(e.g., Houshmand, Livingston, &amp; Wallace, 1999). Most recently (in Septemberof 2003), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sponsored a conferenceentitled <I>Investigating the Mind: Exchanges between Buddhism and the biobehavioralbrain sciences on how the mind works</I>, which featured a dialog betweenleading proponents of the Buddhist and cognitive scientific views of mind.</H3><H3>This seminar will explore attempts by psychologists and Buddhists tounderstand consciousness. The course will be organized topically, focusingon both Western philosophical and psychological accounts of consciousnessand Buddhist theory and practice. The views to be considered include: recentwork by cognitive psychologists, cognitive scientists, and the teachingsof the Buddha as they have been interpreted by his Theravada, Mahayana,and Tibetan followers. Readings will include primary and secondary sourcesfrom each discipline. Students will be evaluated based on general classdiscussion and participation, short weekly reaction papers, in-class presentationsand discussion leading.</H3><H3>&nbsp;</H3><H3>SEMINAR STRUCTURE:</H3><H3>The seminar will be divided into roughly three parts. The first partwill be concerned with outlining the basic problem of consciousness. Thesecond part will be concerned with traditional Buddhist accounts of themind and consciousness. The third part will focus on a comparative analysisof the perspectives considered in the seminar.</H3><H3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participatein an on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reactionpaper for class each week. Class time will be devoted to discussion andto student presentations based on the readings.</H3><H3>&nbsp;</H3><H3>TEXTS:</H3><H3>Dalai Lama, <I>The World of Tibetan Buddhism</I> and <em>The Universe in a   Single Atom</em>.</H3><H3>Houshmand, Z, Livingston, R.

The seminar will beginwith a lecture format (four weeks) as we present an overview of cognitivescience, consciousness and Buddhism. It will then proceed in seminar stylewith SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation. Students will be responsiblefor three areas of activity: 1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3)Discussion Leading.</H3><H3>&nbsp;</H3><H3>1) PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readingsand/or optional Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged forthe seminar.</H3><H3>&nbsp;</H3><H3>2) REACTION PAPERS are 1-2 TYPED PAGES in length and are based on pre-assignedreadings. These ten (10) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection onthe texts. The papers will be evaluated on a &quot;+/0/-&quot; scale. &quot;-&quot;is missing or deficient (D-F). &quot;0&quot; is an adequate summary withlittle or no analysis (B-C). &quot;+&quot; is a thoughtful, critical analysis(A).</H3><H3>&nbsp;</H3><H3>3) DISCUSSION LEADING consists of forming a group of 2 students (byWEEK #3), selecting a topic (by WEEK #3), and leading class discussion duringthe week you present the issues involved in your topic.</H3><H3>&nbsp;</H3><H3>ATTENDANCE POLICY:</H3><H3>Attendance is expected.
