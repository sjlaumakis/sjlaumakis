<H3>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS:
  
  The notion of consciousness--our awareness of the internal and external world--has always been a topic of intense interest to philosophers and scientists, both Eastern and Western.  The Western approach has tended to rely on the scientific method, using empirical investigations and objective inquiry to specify the nature of consciousness.  A recent approach to understanding the nature of consciousness and thought (which has emerged and gained prominence over the past 50 years) is termed cognitive science.  Cognitive science represents an interdisciplinary attempt to understand the nature of thinking, and is rooted primarily in the following disciplines: philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, and anthropology.  </H3>
<H3>Eastern approaches (Buddhism, in particular) are also devoted to investigating and understanding consciousness. However, their focus is on the analysis of subjective experience through meditative practice, and the cultivation of mindfulness—being awake and fully aware.  Buddhists are especially concerned with the practical and moral consequences of this meditative practice. This subjective and contemplative approach to analyzing consciousness can be seen in Western approaches in the form of analytic introspection (a popular tool for analyzing consciousness early in the development of psychology), but was largely abandoned as unscientific. Recently, however, the phenomenological aspects of cognition and consciousness have made a comeback, and there has been an important meeting of Eastern and Western minds with regard to the analysis of consciousness and the possible benefits of mindful awareness. Both traditions are investigating the benefits of meditation for psychological and physical well being, as well as what the meditative state tells us about the nature of consciousness and thought. This seminar will investigate these Eastern and Western approaches to the mind, consciousness and mindfulness.  </H3>
<H3>Readings will include primary and secondary sources from each discipline.  Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation, short weekly reaction papers, in-class presentations and discussion leading. </H3>

  *	This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class 
  participation, and discussion leading.  </H3>
<H3>4.	Learning to analyze and critically evaluate ideas, arguments, and points of view.
  *	This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation, and 		discussion leading.  </H3>
<H3>SEMINAR STRUCTURE:  </H3>
<H3>The seminar will be divided into roughly three parts.  The first part will be concerned with outlining the basic question of consciousness and the concept of mindfulness, and how it's been approached from Eastern and Western perspectives. Next, we'll examine mindfulness from the perspective of Eastern contemplative practice.  The third major section of the course will examine the concept of mindfulness from a psychological/neuroscientific perspective, including empirical investigations of mindfulness (and mindlessness) in everyday life, as well as their consequences for thought and behavior. Finally, we'll discuss how the two views converge and diverge.  </H3>
<H3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in an on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper for class each week.  Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student presentations based on the readings.  </H3>
<H3>TEXTS:  </H3>

<H3>Nhat Hanh, Thich. The Miracle of Mindfulness, Boston: Beacon Press.  </H3>

<H3>ASSIGNMENTS:  </H3>
<H3>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject matter, 
  facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think.  The seminar will begin with a lecture format in the first week as we present an overview 
  of Philosophical and Psychological approaches to consciousness and mindfulness.  It will then proceed in seminar style with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation.  Students will be responsible for four areas of activity: 1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3) Discussion Leading.  </H3>
<H3>1) 	PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readings. It is critical that you 
  read, reflect, and come ready to discuss. Participation will also be possible through 
  MINDFULNESS BLOGS.  Mindfulness is all about first-person observation, and engaging in 
  an all-encompassing awareness of what's going on around you. We want you to seek out 
  opportunities to be mindful, or to reflect on mindfulness (outside of just thinking about the 
  reading). Try to experience mindful states, and then report on your own experience, and 
  respond to the posts of others.  How do you experience mindful states? Follow Thich Nhat 
  Hanh's and/or Wallace's instructions - - do them as exercises, and report on your results. 
  Turn off your cell phone for an hour. Don't log in to Facebook for a day; just sit and reflect. 
  What do you experience? And of course, respond to the posts of others; we want these to be 
  ongoing conversations. Everyone should be active in both class discussions and blog discussions.
  Active engagement (consistent and substantive contributions just about every week) in 
  both will be necessary for an "A" on this component.  </H3>
<H3>2) 	REACTION PAPERS are 1-2 TYPED PAGES in length and are based on the reading for
  that week. These ten (10) papers should be a critical analysis/reflection on the texts. The 	papers will be evaluated on a “+/0/-“ scale.  “-“ is missing or deficient (D-F). “0” is an 
  adequate summary with little or no analysis (B-C). “+” is a thoughtful, critical analysis (A). 
  These reaction papers are different from the blogs (below) in that they will provide a 
  critical reflection on the topics covered in the reading.  </H3>
<H3>3) 	DISCUSSION LEADING consists of forming a group of 2 students (by WEEK #3), 
  selecting a topic/week  (by WEEK #2) and leading class discussion during that week 
  Discussion leaders work in teams of 2-3, and will be responsible for coming up with a set
  of discussion points or questions that correspond to the reading for that week. These 
  questions  must be posted by NOON the Sunday before class. Discussion leaders will also 
  be responsible for finding some interesting outside reading and/or ideas to report on or 
  work into class discussion. Many relevant resources (perhaps all you need) are posted on the 
  course Blackboard site, under "Links" and "Outside Readings".  </H3>
<H3>ATTENDANCE POLICY:  </H3>
<H3>Attendance is expected.  Excessive absence may result in grade reduction. Turn off your cell phones! Especially in this class!  </H3>
<H3>GRADE DISTRIBUTION:  </H3>
<H3>Participation (In-class and blogging) = 40% 
  (25% in-class, 15% blog)  </H3>
<H3>Reaction Papers = 35%  </H3>
<H3>Discussion Leading = 15%  </H3>
<H3>Additional 10% - Add in where you want
  
  
  2009 – </H3>
<H3>2010 Syllabus Statement Related to Influenza
  (From the Office of Student Affairs via the Dean of CAS):  </H3>
<H3>The University of St. Thomas is committed to a healthy campus community. During the 2009-2010 academic year, there will be ongoing concerns regarding the prevalence among university faculty, staff and students of both the H1N1 virus and seasonal influenza.  To help limit the spread of these illnesses, the Centers for Disease Control has provided college campuses the following recommendation: students, faculty, or staff with influenza like illnesses (temperature of 100.0 or greater, plus a cough or sore throat) are directed to self-isolate (or stay home) for at least 24 hours after their fever is gone without the use of fever-reducing medicine. In the event that students are unable to attend classes due to this self-isolation recommendation, they should consult the university’s pandemic web site http://www.stthomas.edu/pandemic/plan/default.html and complete an on-line form informing professors of their absence. In accordance, faculty will provide opportunities for these students to participate in alternative educational delivery due to this illness.  </H3>
<H3>Our Translation of the H1N1/Influenza Policy:  </H3>
<H3>Students with influenza symptoms (temperature of 100° or greater accompanied by a cough or sore throat) should stay home from classes and minimize their contact with other people from the onset of symptoms until at least 24 hours after their fever has returned to normal without the use of fever-reducing medicine. 
  
  Students unable to attend classes due to influenza should consult the university’s pandemic web site http://www.stthomas.edu/pandemic/plan/default.html and complete the on-line form informing professors of their absence.
  
  Students who miss class due to illness are encouraged to talk to classmates about getting their lecture notes and to make an appointment with the instructor (as needed) in order to review material covered during classes they were unable to attend.
  
  In the event of a serious outbreak of influenza on campus, faculty will provide opportunities for students with flu-like illnesses to participate in alternatives to standard classroom instruction. 
  
  Of course, things could change depending on what the Administration says! </H3>
